Aim:
To kill Internet Explorer < 8... though it would be nice to kill IE 8 too.

Use:
I don't have access to a CDN, so you're going to have to store this somewhere on 
your webspace.

Configure:
Change the css to what you would like to see, upload it, and change the path in 
the Javascipt to that file.

IE6
<!--[if IE lt 7]><script src="pathtoie.js"></script><![endif]-->

IE7
<!--[if IE lt 8]><script src="pathtoie.js"></script><![endif]-->
